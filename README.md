# Arduino_ESP32
This is the re-make of a analogue gauge originally designed by Bodmer I believe. I have programmed this sketch using the Arduino_GFX_Library.

I am new to gethub, so at the moment I havn't got much to say, other than I hope you find theis sketch useful, as unlike the orignal i feel you do not need 
to know about geometry to use it.
